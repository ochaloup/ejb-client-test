= Simple client

EJB client for jboss eap

Initialy this should be a simple reproducer for leaking client connections but I'm not able to find out where the leak happens
in my test code of txn testsuite (could be a test issue).

This simple try works well.


== HOW TO

`mvn package` will package the ear and client jar. Then you need to deploy and run client

```
cp ear/target/ejb-client-connection-leak-ear-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.ear ~/jboss/jboss-eap-last/standalone/deployments/
java -cp client/target/ejb-client-connection-leak-client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:api/target/api.jar:/home/ochaloup/jboss/jboss-eap-last/bin/client/jboss-client.jar:/ org.jboss.qe.ClientMain
<press ENTER>
```

or with JBOSS_HOME

```
cp ear/target/ejb-client-connection-leak-ear-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.ear $JBOSS_HOME/standalone/deployments/
java -cp client/target/ejb-client-connection-leak-client-1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:api/target/api.jar:$JBOSS_HOME/bin/client/jboss-client.jar:. org.jboss.qe.ClientMain
<press ENTER>
```
